"Java qr code reader using ZBar, JNative & dsj.

ZBar has it's own JNI interface, but it's now default compiled in. And its default video capture interface does not work on my WebCam which is of high-definition. So I created this project, which uses dsj for video capture and ZBar for decoding. It just works for windows by now."



The library dsj is not free, open source software. The library is free for use in non-commercial projects only.
